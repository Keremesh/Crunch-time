          What is Simon’s Cat? Simon’s Cat is a charming, yet mischievous cat
          that lives with his long suffering owner – Simon. He made his first
          appearance online, in a film called Cat Man Do, made by animator and
          illustrator, Simon Tofield. Since then he has appeared in books, games
          and comic strips. Who is Simon Tofield? Simon is an English animator,
          who has a great interest in British wildlife, painting, the great
          outdoors and of course cats. Simon started animating at a very young
          age. Inspired by cartoons on TV, he used to create basic flip-books in
          an attempt to emulate the techniques he saw being used on screen. You
          can find out more about how he created Simon’s Cat in his film – The
          Simon’s Cat Story. What is the name of Simon’s Cat the character? The
          character is simply known as ‘Simon’s Cat’. Does Simon have a cat in
          real life? Simon had and have several cats throughout the years. Their
          names are: Jess, Maisy, Hugh, Teddy, Poppy and Lilly. Hugh was the
          main inspiration behind the first Simon’s Cat film –Cat Man Do and
          Teddy was the inspiration for the Kitten character. Unfortunately Hugh
          passed away in 2015. You can read Simon’s tribute to Hugh here. Jess
          also passed away in 2016 and now Simon has adopted the mother –
          daughter pair of Poppy and Lilly. Read more about them on

          <h4>Simon</h4>
          <p>
            Simon is an illustrator and a full-time cat daddy to two naughty cats:
            Cat and Kitten. He spends a lot of time talking to his cats (which
            some of the neighbors find a little strange), exploring his garden and
            the creatures that live in it. Simon can be very indecisive and shy so
            a lot of his decisions are motivated by the cat’s needs!

          <h4>Cat</h4>
          <p>
            Simon and Cat are an unbreakable duo. Simon relies on Cat as much as
            Cat relies on Simon. Cat loves being outside and exploring the garden,
            and having his best friend Simon with him all day, makes for one very
            happy kitty. Although he tries to help, things don’t always go as
            smoothly as planned.

          <p>
            A cheeky little kitten who’s Iike an annoying younger brother to
            Simon’s Cat. He’s cute, a bit clumsy and always wants to play. He’s
            still learning about the world and will happily follow Simon’s Cat
            wherever he goes, watching his every move – much to the cat’s
            annoyance…

          <h4>Chloe</h4>
          <p>
            Beautiful, sophisticated (and maybe a bit snobbish), Chloe is a
            pedigree princess of the gardens. Cat is infatuated by her and is
            constantly trying to impress her. Unfortunately for Cat, she isn’t
            easily impressed (but secretly finds him a little charming). She loves
            to wander which does leave Penny in a bit of a panic…

          <h4>Teddy</h4>
          <p>
            Teddy is a charming but slightly aloof feral cat, who has been living
            in the park for many years. He’s had to become an expert fisherman to
            survive, so you’ll often find him near a pond or lake. As Teddy often
            catches more than he can eat, Cat often drops by for lunch.
